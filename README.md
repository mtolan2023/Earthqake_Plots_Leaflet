# Plotting Earthquake data using Leafet

This project uses GEOJSON data to plot earthquakes in the US, using Leaflet to build a map. It makes it apparent where earthquakes are happening the most frequently as well as the depth, intensity and time of each earthquake. These visualizations make it possible to easily view the locations of highest earthquake frequency and intensity in the US.

Earthquake data taken from the USGS: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

The maps are plotting all 1.0+ earthquakes from the last 30 days.

### Part 1:

Contains index.html, js and css files necessary to render the earthquake plots.
